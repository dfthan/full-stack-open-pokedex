11.1 warming up assignment
I would choose Python programming language because I have a little bit of previous experience from MOOC courses.

Most common linting tool for python based off of quick googling is flake8 or pylint, so I would most likely choose flake8.
Selecting libraries that are proven to work in use is a huge time savior overall, especially if the documentation is good.

For testing I would pick pytest, because it provides simple and compact testing. Pytest also has large community backing it.

Python is an interpreted language, so there is no build phase besides triggering automatic tests for the new commit.

Possible CI alternatives are GitLab CI, Microsoft Azure's own pipelines, CirleCI and maybe less known BitBucket.

It makes a lot more sense to host scaling services in the cloud due to them being more flexible resource-wise.
That makes cloud hosting also better budget wise in a company, because you may not know how much processing power you need.
Buying actual physical servers is quite expensive afterall.
